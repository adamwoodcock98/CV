# CV

With a background in finance and learning/development, problem solving and efficiency has been at the forefront of my professional life. As an individual, I find my energy through creativity, passion and a drive to be the best possible version of myself. For the past few years I've know software development as the perfect way to marry my logical, problem-solving acuity, with my desire to create, collaborate and grow.

In January of this year, I took the leap and enrolled with Makers Academy. Here, coding fundamentals such as pair-programming and agile development, through to full-stack, test-driven MERN applications are drilled in from day 1. Through the coding practices, EQ curriculum and culture at Makers, I was made to feel like I truly belonged. 

As a queer person, bringing a safe, welcoming and personable experience to my team does not only align with my values, but with who I am at my core. I'm thrilled by the prospect of working in a company where best practices - both technically and personally - are at the beating heart of the team experience.
