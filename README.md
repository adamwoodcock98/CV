With a background in finance and learning/development, problem solving and efficiency has been at the forefront of my professional life. As an individual, I find my energy through creativity, passion and a drive to be the best possible version of myself. For the past few years I've know software development as the perfect way to marry my logical, problem-solving acuity, with my desire to create, collaborate and grow.

In January of this year, I took the leap and enrolled with Makers Academy. Here, coding fundamentals such as pair-programming and agile development, through to full-stack, test-driven MERN applications are drilled in from day one. Alongside best coding practices and an EQ curriculum, Makers has equipped me with the skills I need to seamlessly integrate into a professional workflow. As a queer person, bringing a safe, welcoming and personable experience to my team does not only align with my values, but with who I am at my core. I'm thrilled by the prospect of working in a company where best practices - both technically and personally - are at the beating heart of the team experience.

## Soft Skills

#### Intuition
I've always found pride in my natural sense of intuition. This skill grants me the ability to learn new concepts rapidly and adapt to change with very little friction. For example, during my time at Addison Lee, I was promoted straight into a management role seven months after joining, making me the fastest promotion of that scale in the company. Subsequent feedback from several interviews attributed my success to my willingness and ease when stepping outside of my role.

#### Communication
The EQ curriculum at Makers trained us extensively on [giving and receiving good feedback](https://medium.com/@adam.woodcock98/receiving-feedback-is-a-gift-999628b6b14c). As a coach, [empathetic](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/Empathy%20Workshop%20-%209th%20March%202022.md), active listening was paramount to the success of my trainees and, consequently, my team. I trained on leadership and communication styles, body language, and more in my time there. My written work is practical and adaptive, whether it's for [informal notes](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/Model-View-Controller%20(MVC).md), [technical walkthroughs](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/debugging-walkthrough.md), direct [reflections of personal challenges](https://medium.com/@adam.woodcock98/time-for-reflection-and-introspection-makers-day-27-2f2da0370486), or company-wide comms at Addison Lee.

Outside of the professional, I am a very social person, and I emotionally thrive from the connections in my life.
