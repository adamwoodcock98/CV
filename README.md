With a finance and learning/development background, problem-solving and efficiency have been at the forefront of my professional life. However, as an individual, I find my energy through creativity, passion and a drive to be the best possible version of myself. From the moment I first coded in College,  I've known software development as the perfect way to marry my logical, problem-solving acuity with my desire to create, collaborate, and grow. As a queer person, bringing a safe, welcoming and personable experience to my team does not only align with my values but with who I am at my core. I'm thrilled by the prospect of working in a company where best practices - both technically and personally - are at the beating heart of the team experience.

## Soft Skills

#### Communication
The EQ curriculum at Makers trained us extensively on [giving and receiving good feedback](https://medium.com/@adam.woodcock98/receiving-feedback-is-a-gift-999628b6b14c). As a coach, [empathetic](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/Empathy%20Workshop%20-%209th%20March%202022.md), active listening was paramount to the success of my trainees and, consequently, my team. I trained on leadership and communication styles, body language, and more in my time there. My written work is practical and adaptive, whether it's for [informal notes](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/Model-View-Controller%20(MVC).md), [technical walkthroughs](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/MakersPortfolio/blob/main/Evidence/debugging-walkthrough.md), direct [reflections of personal challenges](https://medium.com/@adam.woodcock98/time-for-reflection-and-introspection-makers-day-27-2f2da0370486), or company-wide comms at Addison Lee.

Outside of the professional, I am a very social person, and I emotionally thrive from the connections in my life.

#### Collaboration
At Addison Lee, we were a team of coaches responsible for our staff; we worked together to deliver training consistently, identify improvement areas, and nurture team and trainee KPIs. I worked closely with management at Classic Interiors, where our strategic teamwork grew the turnover by 485% and opened an additional two locations in just three short years. At Makers, collaboration dictated the success of our projects; we frequently ran standups and retrospectives as a team and mobbed planning/design/brainstorming sessions.

I operate well independently, though I deliver my best results in a collaborative environment. I feel tremendous joy when success is a mutual celebration and work at my happiest when sharing ideas, input, and support; this was, without doubt, my favourite element of the Makers Bootcamp.

#### Confidence
Whether it's moving to a new country at age 11, deciding to change my life and join an intensive Bootcamp, or holding my chin up high in the face of prejudice, my experiences in life have humbled me. This acquaintance with the uncomfortable imbued confidence that I use in all facets of my life. I will not back down to a challenge; I give vigorously to any opportunity presented; I do not hesitate to ask difficult questions, and I'm willing to put myself out of my comfort zone to learn something new.

#### Intuition
I've always found pride in my natural sense of intuition. This skill grants me the ability to learn new concepts rapidly and adapt to change with very little friction. For example, during my time at Addison Lee, I was promoted straight into a management role seven months after joining, making me the fastest promotion of that scale in the company. Subsequent feedback from several interviews attributed my success to my willingness and ease when stepping outside of my role.
